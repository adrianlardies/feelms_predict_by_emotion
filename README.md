# ðŸŽ¬ Feelms - Predict by Emotion

Welcome to Feelms, a movie recommendation app that suggests films based on your emotions! This app uses collaborative filtering and machine learning models to predict your favorite movies and ratings, all while interacting with a MySQL database hosted on AWS.

## Features

- **Emotion-based Recommendations**: Select how you're feeling, and Feelms will suggest movies tailored to your emotions (Happy, Excited, Relaxed, etc.).
- **User Authentication**: Create a new user or log in to your account with a secure system. 
- **Movie Ratings & Favorites**: Rate your favorite movies and save them for easy access in your personal favorites list.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - **SVD (Collaborative Filtering)**: Predicts personalized movie ratings.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts whether a movie will become a favorite based on features like duration and ratings.
- **Streamlit UI**: Simple and intuitive web interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing seamless interaction with the recommendation system.

## How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: 
   - The movie dataset is processed using a combination of EDA and merging of user interactions (ratings, favorites) with movie details.
   - Emotion-based recommendations are generated by mapping movie genres to specific emotions.
   
2. **Machine Learning**: 
   - The **SVD model** is used to predict movie ratings based on past user interactions.
   - The **Random Forest Classifier** predicts whether a movie will become a favorite based on its features (rating, duration).

3. **AWS Integration**:
   - The app connects to a MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS for secure and scalable data management.
   - Movies, ratings, and interactions are stored in this cloud-based database.
   
4. **Streamlit Application**:
   - The web app uses Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
   - Movie recommendations, ratings, and favorites are displayed through an easy-to-navigate UI.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feelms.git
   cd feelms

2. Install de required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the environment variables:

   Streamlit's secrets manager is used to store sensitive information like the database credentials. Add the following to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

   ```toml
   [database]
   DB_HOST = "your-db-host"
   DB_USER = "your-db-user"
   DB_PASSWORD = "your-db-password"
   DB_NAME = "your-db-name"
   DB_PORT = "your-db-port"

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

## Models

- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**:
  - Used for collaborative filtering to predict user ratings for movies.
  - Hyperparameters adjusted for optimal performance (n_factors = 100, lr_all = 0.005).

- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Classifies whether a movie will be a favorite based on its attributes.
  - Tuned for accuracy, precision, and recall. Cross-validation was used to optimize the model.

## AWS Integration

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS, which stores user interactions, favorites, and ratings.
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: The app is deployed on an EC2 instance, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Usage

Once the app is running:

1. **Login** or **Register** as a new user.
2. Choose an **emotion** from the list provided (e.g., Happy, Excited, Relaxed).
3. Browse through the movie recommendations.
4. **Rate movies** and **add them to your favorites**.
5. Enjoy your personalized movie experience!

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Extend functionality to include TV series and documentaries.
- Implement user-based filtering to improve collaboration between users with similar preferences.
